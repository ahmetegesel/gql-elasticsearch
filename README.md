# gql-elasticsearch

A repository for experimenting GraphQL with Node.js

## Purpose

Although the main purpose is to experiment GraphQL on a Node.js server, it was
also intended to experiment a large-scale GraphQL design including different
types of modules and trying to store their functionalities in scope of repositories.

Also, tried to use Functional Paradigm in helper functions to increase reusability, 
testability and to have a non-side effect design.
